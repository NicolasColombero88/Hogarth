# Exercise 1
## Add a new hero section.
##
For this exercise, I approached it from the scalability perspective. By using custom variables and the CSS calculation method, I established a dynamic control that facilitates the division based on the number of heroes to be presented.

By simply adhering to the following module:

<div class="multiHero">
  <figure class="multiHero-image"></figure>
  <div class="hero-copy">
    <h2>Space</h2>
    <h3>The final frontier.</h3>
   </div>
   <!-- LINK -->
   <a class="multiHero-link" href="http://space.com/"></a>
</div>


The hero section can be distributed *N* number of times.
And with the dynamic controls (*customHero.css*), the distribution can be set per line in a responsive manner (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).


:root {
  --dividerDesk: 2;
  --dividerTab: 2;
  --dividerMob: 1;
  }


# Exercise 2
## Fix the order of the timeline.

In this exercise, the goal was to achieve a mosaic effect with vertical adjustment and proper implementation of responsive design using CSS. It proved to be challenging. To be honest, it is the aspect I paid the most attention to. After struggling for a while with *flex* and *grid*, I gave up and took the path of creating two HTMLs to achieve the responsive vision. The visibility is determined by the classes .desktop and .mobile.
# Exercise 3
## Support the gallery on older browsers.

In this exercise, I accepted the suggestion to maintain alignment using *float* and *flex*.

To view one option or the other, it's a matter of commenting out the piece of code that we don't want to display. These sections are clearly divided by descriptive comments.
